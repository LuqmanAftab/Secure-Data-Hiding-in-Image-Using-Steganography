# Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

A Python implementation of secure image steganography that combines AES encryption with LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography for hiding sensitive information within images.

## Introduction

This project implements a robust method to conceal confidential data within digital images. The implementation follows these key steps:

1. **Encryption**: The secret message is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in CBC mode with a secure 256-bit key.
2. **Binary Conversion**: The encrypted data is converted into binary format.
3. **LSB Embedding**: The binary data is embedded into the least significant bits of the image pixels, making the modifications imperceptible to the human eye.
4. **Extraction & Decryption**: To retrieve the hidden message, the process is reversedâ€”extracting the LSB data, converting it back to bytes, and decrypting it using the same AES key.

This combination of cryptography and steganography provides two layers of security: even if someone suspects steganography is being used, they would still need the encryption key to access the actual message.

## Features

- Strong AES-256 encryption in CBC mode with a randomly generated initialization vector (IV)
- LSB steganography with minimal visual impact on carrier images
- Support for color (RGB) images in common formats (PNG, BMP, JPEG, etc.)
- Command-line interface for easy integration
- Automatic key management for encryption and decryption
- Validation to ensure the carrier image has sufficient capacity

## Resources Used

- **Python 3.7+**: Core programming language
- **NumPy**: For efficient image array manipulation
- **Pillow**: For image processing
- **PyCryptodome**: For AES encryption/decryption
- **Argparse**: For command-line argument parsing

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LuqmanAftab/Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy Pillow pycryptodome
   ```

### Usage

#### Hiding a Message

To hide a message inside an image:

```sh
python Steganography_main.py
```

**This will:**
- Upload image and enter secret text.
- Provide a password to securely hide text messages within images using steganography.
- Encrypt messages using AES (CBC mode) before embedding them into images.
- Convert encrypted data into a binary format to embed within image pixels' least significant bits (LSBs).

#### Extracting a Message

Extracting the hidden message from an image involves:

- Extract hidden messages from stego images and decrypt them with a password.
- Utilize OpenCV and PIL for image processing.
- Offer a user-friendly interface using Tkinter to select images for embedding and extraction.
- Ensure data security by requiring a password to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- Handle errors like incorrect passwords, insufficient image size, and invalid decryption attempts.

## Security Considerations

- Always keep the encryption key secure and separate from the stego image.
- For maximum security, run the program in a secure, offline environment.
- The stego image should not be compressed or modified after embedding the data.

## Limitations

- The carrier image must have sufficient capacity to store the encrypted message.
- Works best with lossless image formats (PNG, BMP) rather than lossy formats (JPEG).
- This method does not conceal the presence of steganography, only the hidden content.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for alternative steganography techniques (DCT, wavelet-based methods).
- Additional encryption algorithms beyond AES-256.
- Password-based key derivation for added security.
- Image quality analysis tools to detect distortions.
- Spread-spectrum techniques for improved robustness against detection.
